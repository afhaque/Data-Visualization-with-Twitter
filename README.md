## Overview ##

The Internet is home to an almost insurmountable amount of raw data. While humans are great at a lot of things like riding bikes and depleting Earth's natural resources, we aren't so great at parsing big data. Luckily, computers are really good at parsing big data. We can even ask computers to process that data and output a result that is significant to us. 

We'll use [Twitter](http://twitter.com) as our source of data, since Twitter's always happening and it has a pretty intuitive API.
